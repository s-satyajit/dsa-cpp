# ðŸš€ My DSA Journey in C++

This repository is my **personal journey** of learning and mastering **Data Structures & Algorithms** using C++.  
It starts from the very basics and will keep **growing step-by-step**, as I learn new concepts and solve more problems.  

Just like building a strong tower, I am laying one brick at a time â€” problem by problem, topic by topic.  
Over time, this repo will become my **complete notebook** of DSA knowledge.

## ðŸ“… Journey So Far
- **Day 1:** Started with basic arrays
- **Day 2:** Learned how to find the minimum in an array
- *(More days and topics will be added as I progress)*

---

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
The repository is organized **topic-wise**:
- **Arrays/** â†’ Array problems and algorithms
- **Strings/** â†’ String manipulations and algorithms
- **LinkedList/** â†’ Linked List implementations
- **Sorting/** â†’ Sorting algorithms
- *(More folders will appear as I learn)*

---

## ðŸŽ¯ My Goals
- Strengthen **problem-solving skills**
- Build **strong fundamentals** in DSA
- Prepare for **product-based company interviews**
- Learn to **analyze time & space complexity** effectively
